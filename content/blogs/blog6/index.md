summary: "I tested LLMs' ability to predict similar links in complex systems using a thought experiment in the 'Arc' World. Inspired by the ARC-AGI benchmark, I created hidden relationships where objects had different meanings. The experiment revealed LLMs struggle with semantic ambiguity and adapting to unseen structures. This highlights challenges in enabling reasoning and generalization in AI."
