summary: "This blog presents my research and engineering efforts in language model reasoning, abstract representation of linked entities, and link prediction. It explores my work at BMZ, where I developed agentic multi-hop reasoning systems for policy decisions, and how this experience led me to investigate hidden relationships in complex datasets. Through Swan AI, I examined whether language models can learn, predict, and represent unseen links in dynamic databases. The blog discusses experiments, insights from ARC-AGI, agency in dynamic learning pipelines, and the role of hypothesis cycles in continual learning, culminating in a proposed framework for link prediction and adaptive data representation."
