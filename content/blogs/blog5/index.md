description: "" 
summary: "I developed Swan AI to explore hybrid vector-graph representations for complex, interrelated systems. The goal was a data pipeline enabling AI to search, converse, and query while preserving hierarchical relationships. Existing knowledge graphs and vector databases lacked dynamic dependency modeling, prompting our exploration of six graphical representations, including hybrid vector-graph models and TensorDB. The core research question: Can LLMs infer hidden relationships in unstructured, hierarchical data to automate decision-making?"
