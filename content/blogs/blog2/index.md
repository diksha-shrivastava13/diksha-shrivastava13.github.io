summary: "In 2024, I worked on a GovTech AI system to automate decision-making over deeply hierarchical, unstructured reports. Initially envisioned as a multi-agentic workflow, the project revealed fundamental challenges in reasoning over hidden relationships across multidimensional data. Similar to optimizing strategic imperfection in chess, the system had to dynamically infer cross-level dependencies, making explicit what was never writtenâ€”highlighting core reasoning failures in current AI approaches."
