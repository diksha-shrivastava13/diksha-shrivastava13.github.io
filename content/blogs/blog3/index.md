summary: "In this deep dive, I break down my iterative modifications to Naïve RAG, tackling the challenge of retrieving and reasoning over complex, hierarchical reports with hidden entity relationships. From agentic parsing and multi-hop retrieval to metadata-validated vector databases, I detail how I optimized retrieval, generation, and reasoning pipelines—reducing response time from 5 minutes to 15 seconds. This post unpacks key technical challenges, my final agentic reasoning pipeline, and the lessons learned in designing AI systems for high-stakes government use cases."
