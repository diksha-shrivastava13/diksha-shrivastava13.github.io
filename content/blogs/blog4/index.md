summary: "While working on BMZ's AI system, I realized the problem required a merged vector-graph approach, but the closed nature of the project limited its broader impact. A friend's advice to 'generalize it' led me to formalize holistic, interrelated systemsâ€”complex, multi-layered decision-making structures where subsystems interact dynamically. Inspired by Taikyoku Shogi, I explored how AI can infer hidden dependencies within unstructured data, a challenge spanning domains like global logistics, finance, and governance. The key research question emerged: **Can we automate the discovery of implicit relationships in such systems?**"
