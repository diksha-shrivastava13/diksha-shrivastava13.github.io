summary: "A robust framework for reasoning requires more than memorization; it must dynamically form and refine hypotheses. Inspired by theorem-proving frameworks, I propose a dynamic database with static relationships and evolving entities, enabling hypothesis cycles and similar link prediction. This method allows LLMs to infer hidden relationships across subsystems, addressing challenges in AI-driven scientific discovery and decision-making."
