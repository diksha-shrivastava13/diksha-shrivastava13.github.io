summary: "This paper explores how language models generate and refine internal hypotheses while constructing world models, aiming to bridge their latent reasoning with structured external representations. By analyzing iterative hypothesis cycles, we investigate whether fundamental system rules emerge from latent space dynamics and propose methods to extract and refine these representations for structured reasoning."

##### Preliminary Abstract

Language models construct implicit world models as they process information, yet their latent space reasoning remains 
disconnected from explicit external representations. We propose a framework that bridges latent space reasoning to 
structured world model representations by analyzing the iterative hypothesis cycles formed as a model refines its 
understanding of a complex system. Our approach examines the evolving structure of hypotheses generated within the 
latent space, identifying recurring patterns that suggest fundamental governing rules. By capturing these patterns, 
we aim to translate the modelâ€™s internal abstractions into explicit, verifiable representations, enabling structured 
reasoning over dynamic environments. We outline a methodology to extract and refine these latent-world mappings, 
incorporating external memory, hypothesis evaluation mechanisms, and structured priors. Through targeted experiments, 
we assess whether fundamental principles of a system can be recovered, analyzed, and aligned with human-interpretable 
structures. This work advances our ability to create autonomous reasoning agents capable of adaptive world model 
construction, a crucial step toward AI systems that continuously learn and refine their understanding of reality.
